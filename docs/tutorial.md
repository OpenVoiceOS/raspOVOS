## Step 1: Prepare Your Hardware  

### Raspberry Pi Model Recommendations  
- **Recommended:** Raspberry Pi 4 or 5.  
  - For offline STT (speech-to-text), the **Raspberry Pi 5** offers significant performance improvements.  
- **Minimum Requirement:** Raspberry Pi 3.  
  - **Note:** The Raspberry Pi 3 will work but may be **extremely slow** compared to newer models.  

### Storage Options  
- **SD Card or USB Storage:**  
  - You can use either a microSD card or a USB drive.  
- **Recommended:** USB SSD Drive for maximum speed and performance.  
  - Connect the USB drive to the **blue USB 3.0 port** for optimal performance.  

### Power Supply Considerations  
Raspberry Pi boards are notoriously **picky about power supplies**. Insufficient power can lead to performance issues, random reboots, or the appearance of the **undervoltage detected** warning (a lightning bolt symbol in the top-right corner of the screen).  

- **Recommended Power Supplies:**  
  - Raspberry Pi 4: 5V 3A USB-C power adapter.  
  - Raspberry Pi 5: Official Raspberry Pi 5 USB-C power adapter or equivalent high-quality adapter with sufficient current capacity.  
- **Common Issues:**  
  - Using cheap or low-quality chargers or cables may result in voltage drops.  
  - Long or thin USB cables can cause resistance, reducing the power delivered to the board.  
- **How to Fix:**  
  - Always use the official power adapter or a trusted brand with a stable 5V output.  
  - If you see the **"undervoltage detected"** warning, consider replacing your power supply or cable.

## Step 2: Install RaspOVOS Image  

1. **Download and Install Raspberry Pi Imager**  
   - Visit [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and download the appropriate version for your OS.  
   - Install and launch the imager.  

2. **Flash the Image to Storage**  
   - Insert your SD card or USB drive into your computer.  
   - In the Raspberry Pi Imager:  
     - **Choose OS:** Select "Use custom" and locate the RaspOVOS image file.  
     - **Choose Storage:** Select your SD card or USB drive.

3. **Advanced Configuration Options**  
   - Click **Next** and select **Edit Settings** to customize settings, including:  
     - **Password:** Change the default password.  
     - **Hostname:** Set a custom hostname for your device.  
     - **Wi-Fi Credentials:** Enter your Wi-Fi network name and password.  
     - **Keyboard Layout:** Configure the correct layout for your region.  

   **Important:** **Do NOT change the default username** (`ovos`), as it is required for the system to function properly.

4. **Write the Image**  
   - Click **Save** and then **Yes** to flash the image onto your storage device.  
   - Once complete, safely remove the SD card or USB drive from your computer.

## Step 3: Initial Setup and First Boot  

### Connect and Power On  
- Insert the SD card or connect the USB drive to your Raspberry Pi.  
- Plug in the power supply and connect an HDMI monitor to observe the boot process.  

### First Boot Process  
1. **Initialization:**  
   - The system will expand the filesystem, generate SSH keys, and perform other setups.  
2. **Reboots:**  
   - The device will reboot **up to three times** during this process.  
3. **Autologin:**  
   - The `ovos` user will automatically log in to the terminal after boot.  

4. **Check System Status:**  
   - Use the `ologs` command to monitor logs and confirm that the system has fully initialized.

## Step 4: Setting Up Wi-Fi  

### Option 1: Configure Wi-Fi Using Raspberry Pi Imager  
The most straightforward method is to set up Wi-Fi during the imaging process.  

1. Open Raspberry Pi Imager and select Edit Settings Option.  
2. Enter your **SSID (Wi-Fi network name)** and **password** in the Wi-Fi configuration fields.  
3. Write the image to your SD card or USB drive, and your Wi-Fi will be pre-configured.  

### Option 2: Use Audio-Based Wi-Fi Setup (ggwave)  

1. Open [ggwave Wi-Fi setup](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-audio-transformer-plugin-ggwave/) on a device with speakers.  
2. Enter your **SSID** and **password** and transmit the data as sound.  
3. Place the transmitting device near the Raspberry Pi microphone.  
4. If successful, youâ€™ll hear an acknowledgment tone.  
   - If decoding fails or credentials are incorrect, youâ€™ll hear an error tone.  

ðŸš§ **Note:** ggwave is a **work-in-progress** feature and does not have any dialogs or provide on-screen feedback. ðŸš§

## Step 5: Running OVOS  

### OVOS First Launch  
- On the first run, OVOS may take longer to initialize.  
- When ready, OVOS will say: **"I am ready"** (requires an Internet connection).  

---

## Step 6: Using OVOS Commands  

### Helpful Commands  
Once the terminal appears, youâ€™ll see a guide with OVOS commands. Some key commands include:  

- **Configuration:**  
  - `ovos-config` â€” Manage configuration files.  
- **Voice Commands:**  
  - `ovos-listen` â€” Activate the microphone for commands.  
  - `ovos-speak <phrase>` â€” Make OVOS speak a specific phrase.  
- **Skill Management:**  
  - `ovos-install [PACKAGE_NAME]` â€” Install OVOS packages.  
  - `ovos-update` â€” Update all OVOS and skill packages.  
- **Logs and Status:**  
  - `ologs` â€” View logs in real-time.  
  - `ovos-status` â€” Check the status of OVOS-related services.  

You use the command `ovos-help` to print the message with all commands again at any point

### Check Logs in Real-Time  
- Use the `ologs` command to monitor logs live on your screen.  
- If youâ€™re unsure whether the system has finished booting, check logs using this command.
