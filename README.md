# RaspOVOS

Using [dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier](https://github.com/dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier) we download
a [raspios_lite_arm64](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_arm64/images) image and modify it to install OVOS
on top

The images are then uploaded to [github releases](https://github.com/TigreGotico/raspOVOS/releases)
