# RaspOVOS

Using [dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier](https://github.com/dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier), we download
a [raspios_lite_arm64](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_arm64/images) image and modify it to install OVOS
on top. The customized images are then uploaded to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/releases).

## üìã Notes:

- **Default user**: `ovos`
- **Default password**: `ovos`
- **Default hostname**: `raspOVOS`
- OVOS services run under the `ovos` user, with autologin enabled.
