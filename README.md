# RaspOVOS

Using [dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier](https://github.com/dtcooper/rpi-image-modifier), we download a [raspios_lite_arm64](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_arm64/images) image and modify it to install OVOS on top. The customized images are then uploaded to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/releases). üéâ

## üìã Notes:
- **Default user**: `ovos`  
- **Default password**: `ovos`  
- **Default hostname**: `raspOVOS`  
- OVOS services run under the `ovos` user, with autologin enabled.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This repository is a work in progress to replace the [old-raspOVOS](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ZZZ-raspOVOS) built on top of `pigen`. If this warning is still here, the images do not yet have feature parity!

### üìÇ Latest Images:
Find the latest images on the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/releases) page.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started:
Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/raspOVOS/blob/master/tutorial.md) for instructions.

| `setup_udev.sh`        | Configures udev rules for setting I/O scheduler for MMC and USB devices to "none", minimizing latency for disk and removable storage.               | This can reduce latency and improve performance for flash-based storage like MMC and USB devices. Flash storage does not require complex scheduling algorithms because it has no moving parts (like hard drives), so a simpler, more direct I/O approach is more efficient. |
| `setup_wlan0power.sh`  | Copies the `wlan0-power.service` systemd service file to `/etc/systemd/system/` and enables it to manage Wi-Fi power consumption.                   | Reduces power consumption by disabling Wi-Fi power-saving features, which is important for maintaining stable network performance.                                                                                                                                          |
| `setup_zram.sh`        | Installs and configures ZRAM to create compressed swap space in RAM, improving system performance by reducing disk swap usage.                      | Enhances system performance by reducing reliance on slower disk-based swap and utilizing faster RAM for swap, which is especially useful on limited-resource devices like Raspberry Pi.                                                                                     |

A higher value means more data is kept in memory before writing to disk.                                                                                                |
